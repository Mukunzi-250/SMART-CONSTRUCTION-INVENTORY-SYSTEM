**A PL/SQL-Powered Solution for Construction Businesses!**

Imagine a construction materials business where stock levels are always accurate, sales are
processed instantly, and suppliers are automatically managed—this system makes it happen!

**📋 What's This Project About? 🤔**

Running a construction materials business involves constant challenges: running out of critical 
materials like cement during peak construction seasons, overstocking expensive items like steel
bars, losing track of supplier deliveries, and manual calculation errors in billing. These issues can
cost businesses up to 25% of their potential revenue!

automates inventory tracking, sales processing, and supplier management—ensuring construction
businesses never face stockouts or financial losses due to manual errors.
