# 🎯 Phase I: The Construction Business Challenge

# The Big Problems in Construction Materials Management

**📦 Stock-Outs During Critical Periods 😫**
Imagine a construction project stopping because cement or reinforcement bars are out of stock!
This happens when businesses rely on manual tracking.

**💰 Overstocking Expensive Materials 🏗️**
Steel bars and specialized tiles tie up significant capital. Without proper tracking, 
businesses overstock and strain their finances.

**📝 Manual Calculation Errors 🔢**
Handwritten invoices and manual stock updates lead to billing mistakes and inventory discrepancies.

**🚚 Supplier Performance Unknown 📊**
Which suppliers deliver on time? Which materials are frequently delayed? Without tracking,
businesses can't make informed decisions.
